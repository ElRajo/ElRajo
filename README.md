- Hi, I'm @ElRajo, or you can call me Raj since that's my name.
- I've been programming since I was a wee lad (seriously, I started coding in 1999 using Microsoft Visual J++, which is Microsoft's failed attempt at Java). I'm always looking to expand my horizons though, and will probably not be posting much java/python code on here because I get enough of that at work.
- I'm currently learning Node.js with MongoDB, Express, and React through the ODIN project. If that stack seems familiar to you, it's because the MERN stack is all the rage with the kids nowadays.
- I don't know why anyone would want to reach out to me. Maybe I've finally made that text based rpg and you're enamoured with its rich science fantasy world. Or maybe you just want
to nerd out about science fiction (talk to me about Heinlein or a Culture novel), or maybe you're a recruiter and you want to pay me millions for my awesome coding skillz (cool people still use 'z' instead of 's' right?)
- anyways, send me a message at bhuiyan [dot] rajon [at] gmail.com
